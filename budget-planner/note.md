# Budget Planner Apps

**Description**: an application that allows the user to make a budgeting plan for personal use. It allows the user to create different *virtual* accounts to support their needs. With each account, the user could: make changes to the account balance, delete the account, set a maximum limit to the account. The system also implemented a chaining system, where the user could set up a chain of two or more accounts. When a deposit is made to the chain, it starts from the account at the start of the chain to the end. The deposit amount is moving from one account to another when the limit of the previous account has been reached.
